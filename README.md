# Odin Project #21: Admin Dashboard

The goal of this Odin Project assignment was to create a responsive homepage, something one might find on a portfolio site of sorts. The purpose of this website is to showcase the projects Iâ€™ve built. To avoid repetition I created components for skills, project cards and project sections and the data comes from JavaScript objects stored in the data folder. 

The assignment wanted me to recreate a site using a provided design image in HTML and CSS but I decided to create my own design using Tailwind CSS and React.

I started and finished this project in September 2024.
